## Polymer 2.0

This is a set of examples that show what each of the [Polymer 2.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/) mixins do, so that you can
decide why you might use one or another. They go with my I/O talk that I don't have a link to yet (soon!)

Note: the examples only work in Chrome, because they're assuming native
shadow DOM and custom elements implementations. Web Components (and Polymer)
work in other browsers using [polyfills](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/polyfills).
